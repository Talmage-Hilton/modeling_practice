# Modeling Practice

This repo contains various files I did to practice statistical modeling. This started when I realized I haven't used python in a couple years (I'm getting my Master's degree in statistics, so we use R almost exclusively), so I wanted to remember both how to code in python generally, and how to do some modeling in python. After doing it in python, I couldn't resist doing it in R as well. R is the first coding language I learned, so it holds a special place in my heart, what can I say.

I had two datasets - one with a continuous response and one with a binary response. There were categorical variables in both datasets, so I converted them to dummy variables. Then I made the following models in both python and R with these datasets:
- OLS
- LASSO
- Polynomial Regression
- Natural Splines
- GAM
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Tree (CART)
- Random Forest
- Boosting
- BART (only in R)
- Neural Network

I had a lot of fun doing this and comparing R and python to each other! I noticed several strengths and weaknesses of both languages. Check out my [first blog post](https://talmage-hilton.github.io/Stat-386-Blog/blog/model-explanations/) explaining the statistical models I used, and then [part two](https://talmage-hilton.github.io/Stat-386-Blog/blog/modeling-practice/) that describes how to code them and shares the results from my analysis!
